# ML-Portfolio

This is my GitHub repository for my Term 3 Machine Learning assignment. In this repository, you'll find my K-NN and Linear Regression code, as well as my research report on neural networks.

## Linear Regression - 5 points

My linear regression program processes inputted data and makes predictions based on that data. For example, I used the temperature to predict how much of a specific area was burnt.

## K-NN - 5 points

My K-NN program uses proximity to make classifications and predictions about a single point.

## Neural Network Research Report - 15 points

This is my 750-word report on neural networks that covers everything from neural network architecture and components, to training processes, to different types of networks, and much more. This report is designed to offer a foundational understanding for anyone interested in exploring deep learning and neural network technologies.

## How to Use the Project

For the K-NN and Linear Regression programs, simply open the zips in your file organizer on your computer (e.g., for Macs, this would be Finder). Then, open the code in your coding application of choice and run the code. Be amazed!
